WATER BOOSTER SET - 3 PUMPS (N+1) - VSD CONTROL PANEL
Copy/Paste Specification Clauses (v1.0)

A. GENERAL
1. The contractor shall provide a complete booster control panel assembly for a water booster set controlling three (3) pumps rated 30 kW each.
2. The solution shall support N+1 redundancy and cascade PID pressure control using a discharge pressure feedback signal.
3. The control panel shall be designed for early-stage specification and shall be detailed by the selected system integrator/panel builder during detailed design.

B. ENCLOSURE / MECHANICAL
1. The enclosure shall be floor standing, indoor type, minimum IP54, with provision for bottom cable entry (gland plate or equivalent).
2. The panel shall include an earthing bar, internal wiring ducting, and clear labeling of devices, terminals, and cables.
3. Thermal management shall be provided to keep internal component temperatures within manufacturer limits at maximum load and site ambient conditions.

C. POWER DISTRIBUTION AND PROTECTION
1. The panel shall include a main incoming isolator and/or MCCB sized for the maximum demand and the site fault level.
2. Each VSD feeder shall include appropriate upstream short-circuit and overload protection and a means of isolation as required by applicable standards.
3. Harmonic mitigation (line reactors, filters, or equivalent) and EMC measures shall be included where required by grid code, EMC requirements, or cable length constraints.

D. VSD (VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE) FEEDERS
1. Each pump motor shall be controlled by an individual variable speed drive suitable for 30 kW motor duty.
2. Each VSD shall support Ethernet communications using Modbus TCP for start/stop, speed reference, and monitoring.
3. Each VSD shall provide access to at least the following data over Modbus TCP: run status, speed feedback, current, power, energy, fault status, and fault code.

E. CONTROL SYSTEM (PLC/HMI)
1. The panel shall include a PLC with sufficient Ethernet capacity and I/O to implement:
   - Cascade PID pressure control
   - Pump staging/de-staging
   - Duty/standby alternation and runtime equalization
   - Redundancy and fault handling (N+1)
2. The panel shall include a local HMI for operator control and monitoring (start/stop, setpoints, status, alarms, runtime).
3. The control system shall support a redundant discharge pressure transmitter. Upon primary signal fault/out-of-range, control shall automatically switch to the redundant transmitter and alarm.

F. CONTROL PHILOSOPHY - MINIMUM FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Demand detection: start lead pump when pressure falls below setpoint by a configurable margin or when demand is otherwise detected.
2. Staging logic: add pumps when the system cannot maintain setpoint (e.g., lead speed above a configurable threshold for a configurable time).
3. De-staging logic: remove pumps when demand decreases (e.g., average speed below a configurable threshold for a configurable time) while maintaining stable pressure.
4. Anti-short-cycle: minimum run time and minimum stop time shall be implemented for each pump.
5. Alternation: lead/lag assignment shall rotate automatically based on runtime to equalize wear.
6. Failure handling: if any pump/drive becomes unavailable, remaining pumps shall continue to control pressure within available capacity and generate an alarm.

G. COMMUNICATIONS - MODBUS TCP
1. The PLC shall act as Modbus TCP client/master and each VSD shall act as Modbus TCP server.
2. Each device shall have a unique IP address; an IP plan shall be provided.
3. Loss of communications shall generate an alarm and the system shall transition to a defined safe state.

H. CYBERSECURITY BASELINE (IEC 62443-ALIGNED)
1. The booster control network shall be treated as an industrial control zone and shall be logically separated from corporate networks.
2. Default passwords shall be changed; role-based access and unique user accounts shall be applied where supported.
3. Remote access (if required) shall use secure methods with MFA and audit trail; direct internet access to the control network shall not be permitted.
4. Security-relevant events (login attempts, configuration changes, comms loss) shall be logged.

I. DOCUMENTATION AND TESTING
1. The supplier shall provide electrical drawings (SLD, schematics, GA, terminal schedule), I/O list, network IP plan, PLC/HMI backups, and operating manuals.
2. FAT shall verify wiring, labeling, communications, HMI, and core control sequences including staging/de-staging, alternation, and redundancy behavior.
3. SAT shall verify field wiring, motor rotation, transmitter scaling, PID stability, and redundancy in live operation.
